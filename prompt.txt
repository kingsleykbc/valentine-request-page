Generate this simple valentine request website.

Opening the site shows an envelop with a click to open prompt

Clicking the envelope opens the request (add an animated transition between the 2)

If no is clicked, replace the bear with the angry character and a funny "dem no born you well" message then disable the no button 

If yes is clicked, show the excited bear, transition the background to purple and show the confirmation message. Also shoot confetti.
